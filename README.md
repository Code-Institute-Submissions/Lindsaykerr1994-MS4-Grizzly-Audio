## UX <a name="ux"></a>
![Grizzly Audio Packs](media/media-responsive-graphics.png)<br/>

### User Goals <a name="usergoals"></a>
#### Target Audience
With the number of Digital Audio Workspaces always growing, and with more music producers being able to explore their passions, there is a an increase in the market for components, such as instrument one-shots, or filters that help with mastering and mixing. Grizzly Audio Packs currently offers a variety of instrumental loops for aspiring and established music producers, and in the near future, Grizzly Audio Packs hopes to offer a diverse range of different components that can be used in the product of all genres of music.

### Design <a name="design"></a>

I chose to keep the colour scheme as simple as possible. This will play into the minimalist design layout of the website. Together, the two will allow the functionality of the back-end speak for itself and promote the project. Furthermore, the simplicity of the site will allow users to navigate through the pages, and promote a sense of professionalism and style.
#### Colours:
* Dark Grey: `#292929`
* White: `#ffffff`
* Light Brown: `#9c824a`
* Gold: `#aa842a`
#### Fonts:
Only one font was used throughout these project: Montserrat. This was used in conjunction with font weight: 200 to garnish the pages with a slim, sleek environment.

### Wireframing & Mockups <a name="wireframing"></a>
All wireframes (created with Moqup, see [Tools](#tools)) can found be in the [Media Folder](media/wireframing)

## Features <a name="features"></a>
### Implemented <a name="implemented"></a>
* Accounts/ Profiles<br/>
Although a user is not required to create an account to purchase from Grizzly Audio Packs, they are encouraged to do, as they will have their information saved for further use. Furthermore, any purchases made will be stored under a unique order number. This will allow users to return to any purchase. Customers receive their puchased packs through a download link, therefore if they lose their packs and wish to re-download their purchases, they are able to do so with ease. Unofrtunately, this feature is only available to registered users. If an anonymous user tries to access an order history, they will be redirected.
* Search/ Sorting/ Categories<br/>
When a customer is browsing the packs, they are able to filter the packs on display using a search term, that will search the name or description, by categories, so they can browse similar products, or they can sort all the products by price, name, publication date, or popularity.
* Sample Tracks<br/>
Users are unlikely to purchase audio files for their use without being able hear a sample first. On browsing packs, users are able to play a short sample of the pack in question. This audio file relies on JavaScript to immediately stop playing when closing the pack's modal window so that audio tracks do not play over one another. If a user so wishes to download this sample file, they are able to do so, which is why the sample tracks are kept as short as possible, however they are played in loops for the user's ease.
* Bag and checkout<br/>
Users are able to easily navigate through the bag and checkout pages. All objects entered into the session storage, so that the website will be able to access these objects while the user keeps the window open. On the bag page, users are able to easily see any necessary information, or if desired, they can easily remove packs from their bag. On the checkout page, users are shown how much money they saved by purchasing packs on sale. If the user has a registered profile, their information will be saved upon checkout, if that option is chosen. 
* Store Management<br/>
As a store owner, it is possible to add and edit packs. If on the editing page, the back-end system will load the pack's details into the form for ease of use. Furthermore any media or static files they require to display the pack will be uploaded and saved to the database. In the admin page, storeowners are able to see further details about each pack, such as publication date, or number of sales, so that they can see which packs generate the most income.

### Upcoming <a name="upcoming"></a>
* Coupons & Promotions<br/>
During the checkout stage of a customer's purchase, they will be invited to enter a promotional code that will reduce the grand total of their purchase, or of individual packs. Such promotions will attract new customers or will encourage existing customers to return. These codes will be used to promote a seasonal sale or given out as referrals.
* Similar Packs<br/>
As customers browse the different packs on offer, they will be shown a selection of audio packs that share similar qualities to the one they are currently inspecting. Such qualities would include shared categories, instruments, or even packs that were bought alongside this one by other customers. This will hopefully encourage customers to buy more packs in one purchase.
* Reviews<br/>
This upcoming feature will allow registered users to leave a review, a rating of out 5, and comments, informing other customers of the quality of the audio packs being offered. This will also allow the store owner another criteria in which to filter the packs in the main sale window.

## Technologies <a name="technologies"></a>
### Languages <a name="languages"></a>
In the construction of this project, I utlised four different languages:
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=Hypertext%20Markup%20Language%20(HTML)%20is,scripting%20languages%20such%20as%20JavaScript.) for the front-end foundations.
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) for all webpage aesthics and styling.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
### Manual Testing <a name="manual"></a>
Throughout the development of this webpage, manual testing was implemented in every regard. This testing was simple but effective, testing each individual link, button or function. In this process, I was able to identify and locate every broken page or link before deployment. Unforunately, this testing is not 100% thorough, but it does allow me to simulate the user's experience through every step of a purchase or registration. Such bugs were handled and corrected to the best of my ability. 
Furthermore, before official deployment and project submission, I requested that trusted professionals used the website, attempting to push the site to its boundaries. They were able to analyse every feature or design found on the site.

Further more, I enlisted the help of members of my Slack community, #peer-code-review, to provide any advice or constructive criticism where relevant or necessary. These suggestions were implemented pre-deployment.

### Responsive <a name="responsive"></a>
To confirm the responsiveness of the pages, I ran the project through a [Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly). The test was only able to test one page at a time,so I ran the test with each template, with the results being: "Page is Mobile Friendly", as can be found [here](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=vMS5vOhoXJXS8-1sfNfiWQ). Along side this, I also conducted manual testing for responsiveness, running through the project's multiple pages, using the feature provided by Google Chrome's 'Inspect'. This allowed me to simulate viewing the webpage through the view of standard mobile devices, such as Mobile XS(320x557) or 4K(2560x1392).


### Validation <a name="validation"></a>
No testing would be complete without validation.
I used three different validators/linters:
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* [W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/)
<br />
Any and all problems or issues located by these validators were fixed pre-deployment.
Additionally, to validate any Python styling issues, I used the command in the command-line interface:<br />

`$ flake8`<br />
Any issues identified by this command were corrected to the best of my ability. There were some styling issues that were left unresolved, however these were all related to auto-generated files, such as my migration logs, or code automated in 'grizzly_audio/settings.py'.

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>
### Github Repository <a name="github"></a>
To download a copy of this project's repository, follow this [link](https://github.com/Lindsaykerr1994/MS4-Grizzly-Audio), clicking on the button "Code" > "Download ZIP".
<br/>
This can be opened in your chosen IDE's directory, such as VSCode or GitPod. Alternatively, a copy can be made with:<br/>

`$ git clone https://github.com/Lindsaykerr1994/MS4-Grizzly-Audio`<br/>
This can be run in a virtual environment with, and then activated: <br/>
`$ python3 -m venv venv`<br/>
`$ source venv/bin/activate`<br/>
All packages that were used in creating this project can be found in the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). These packages can be installed with the command:<br/>
`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
All environmental variables can be installed in an `env.py` file, or in the workspace's variables:<br/>
<a name="vars"></a>
| KEY     | VALUE |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 'SECRET_KEY' | <'secret key'>  |
| 'DATABASE_URL' | <'postgres key'> |
| 'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY' | <'stripe public key'> |
| 'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY' | <'stripe secret key'> |
| 'STRIPE_WH_SECRET' | <'stripe webhook key'> |
| 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' | <'aws access key id'> |
| 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' | <'aws access secret key'> |
| 'EMAIL_HOST_USER' | <'email user address'> |
| 'EMAIL_HOST_PASS' | <'email api password'> |

These variables can be set using the code:<br/>
`import os`
`os.environ.setdefault('KEY', 'VALUE')`<br/>
If using a `env.py` file, remember to add this file to your local `.gitignore` file.

After setting these variables, install the JSON data with:<br/>
`$ python3 manage.py migrate`<br/>
`$ python3 manage.py loaddata categories`<br/>
`$ python3 manage.py loaddata packs`<br/>

Finally, create a super user to access all the admin files:<br/>
`$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser`<br/>

Now the server is ready to be run with:<br/>
`$ python3 manage.py runserver`<br/>

### Heroku <a name="heroku"></a>
A tutorial about how to depoloy to Heroku can be found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment)
Once the project has been opened in your preferred IDE, it can be deployed to Heroku (with an existing account) by using the following code in the CLI:<br/>
`$ heroku login`<br/>
`Enter your Heroku credentials.`<br/>
`Email: your@email.com`<br/>
`Password (typing will be hidden):`<br/>
`Authentication successful.`<br/>
Along with the `requirements.txt` file, a `Procfile` is necessary to deploy to Heroku. This file will list the process types found in the web application.<br/>
`web: gunicorn grizzly_audio.wsgi`<br/>
Next, create an application in Heroku, and in the Settings tab, set all Config Vars as seen [above](#vars).
In the resources table, install PostgreSQL
Finally, connect your Heroku app with your GitHub repository in the Deploy tab to allow Automatic Deployment, and then push your project to Heroku.
`$ git add .`<br/>
`$ git commit -m "Commit Message"`<br/>
`$ git push`<br/>
